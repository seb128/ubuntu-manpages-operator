**Ubuntu Manpages Operator** is a [charm](https://juju.is/charms-architecture) for deploying [https://manpages.ubuntu.com](https://manpages.ubuntu.com), a site which contains thousands of dynamically generated manuals, extracted from every supported version of Ubuntu and updated on a regular basis.

This reposistory contains both the [application code](./cmd) and the code for the [charm](./src).

## Basic usage

Assuming you have access to a bootstrapped [Juju](https://juju.is) controller, you can deploy the charm with:

```bash
❯ juju deploy ubuntu-manpages
```

Once the charm is deployed, you can check the status with Juju status:

```bash
❯ juju status
Model     Controller     Cloud/Region  Version  SLA          Timestamp
manpages  concierge-k8s  k8s           3.6.14   unsupported  19:05:33Z

App              Version  Status       Scale  Charm            Channel  Rev  Address        Exposed  Message
ubuntu-manpages           maintenance      1  ubuntu-manpages             1  10.152.183.84  no       Updating manpages

Unit                Workload     Agent  Address     Ports  Message
ubuntu-manpages/0*  maintenance  idle   10.1.0.163         Updating manpages
```

You can see from the status that the application has been assigned an IP address, and is listening on port 8080. Using the example above, browsing to `http://10.245.163.53:8080` would display the homepage for the application.

On first start up, the charm will install the application, ensuring that any packages and configuration files are in place, and will begin downloading and processing manpages for the configured releases.

The charm accepts only one configuration option: `releases`, which is a comma-separated list of Ubuntu releases to include in the manpages, which you can adjust like so:

```bash
❯ juju config ubuntu-manpages releases="questing, plucky, oracular, noble"
```

When a new configuration is applied, the charm will automatically update the manpages to include the new releases, and purge any releases that are present on disk from a previous configuration, but no longer specified.

To update the manpages, you can use the provided Juju [Action](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-actions/):

```bash
❯ juju run ubuntu-manpages/0 update-manpages
```

## Integrating with an ingress / proxy

The charm supports integrations with ingress/proxy services using the `ingress` relation. To test this:

```bash
# Deploy the charms
❯ juju deploy ubuntu-manpages
❯ juju deploy traefik-k8s --trust --config external-hostname=manpages.internal

# Create integrations
❯ juju integrate ubuntu-manpages traefik-k8s

# Test the proxy integration
❯ curl -k -H "Host: manpages.internal" https://<traefik-ip>/<model-name>-ubuntu-manpages
```

The scenario described above is demonstrated [in the integration tests](./tests/integration/test_ingress.py).

## Deployment requirements

As of 2025-07-30, the deployment requirements have been observed to be the following:

- Configured releases: Jammy, Noble, Plucky, Questing
- Disk space used in the `/app/www` folder: `9.4GiB`
- Size of a single release in that folder: `~1.7GiB` (HTML) + `~750MiB` (.gz manpages)
- Stats from the systemd service, on a 4 cores VM: `update-manpages.service: Consumed 1d 2h 50min 47.755s CPU time, 4.7G memory peak, 0B memory swap peak.`
